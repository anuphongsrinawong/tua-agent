- Green for additions, red for deletions, blue for context lines

### #9 — DeepSeek API Setup

- Credential storage and catalog auto-configuration
- (Already completed in v0.0.1, verified in this release)

- Three modes: `ask` (show dialog), `auto-approve` (skip), `auto-deny` (block)
- `/permissions` slash command to toggle permission mode
- Permission mode shown in TUI footer bar
- Approve/Deny buttons with keyboard shortcuts (A/D or Enter/Esc)

### #11 — Interactive Command Palette
- Modal overlay with search/filter input
- Lists all slash commands with descriptions
- Type to filter, arrow keys to navigate, Enter to execute
- Ctrl+P keyboard shortcut
- Shows keyboard shortcuts for each command
- Commands: `/help`, `/profile`, `/model`, `/tools`, `/skills`, `/config`, `/resume`, `/diff`, `/clear`, `/permissions`

### #12 — Multi-Session Tabs
- Tab bar at top of TUI showing open sessions
- Each tab = independent chat session (own profile, model, context)

- `Ctrl+W` — close current tab
- `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` — cycle between tabs
- Tab labels show session name + profile emoji
- `/sessions` command to manage tabs (list, switch, close)
